Ch 1: Introduction
==================

- characteristics of investments

    - cost

        - uncertainty about the share price of a share when you buy it
        - e.g. different types of investments have different characteristics of cost

            - **financial asset**, intangible

                - a contract
                - don't have to use it in order to get the return
                - pretty good idea what the cost is

            - **real asset**, tangible

                - e.g. a machine
                - have to use in order to get benefit
                - cost of investment can vary pretty widely
                    
                    - huge amount of uncertainty when investing in real assets
                    - e.g. BC ferries purchased 3 fast ferries
                        
                        - estimated cost $50mil, actual cost $450mil
                        - found ferries didn't work properly

    - return of investment

        - might be known, or unknown

    - risk: uncertainty
        
        - people look at risk in widely different ways

            - e.g. invest $100 

                - in a year's time, flip a coin

                    - if heads: $102 back
                    - if tails: $110 back

                - avg: 6% return over many flips
                - what's the risk?

                    - 0 risk: attitude of street layman, "what's the chance of losing risk"
                    - 50% risk(?): attitude of finance: "risk is uncertainty, not chance of losing money"
                    
            e.g. invest $100, in a year's time, $106 back

                - what's the risk?

                    - 0 risk: attitude of finance: "risk is uncertainty, not chance of losing money"
    
        - risk premium: if offering risk involved investment, need to offer something additional for the return to entice investment

            - e.g. offering $100 -> 102/110 (6%) when market offers 100 -> 105 (5%) [premium = 1%]

    - evaluation

- points of view on investments

    - corporate

        - looking from within the viewpoint

    - outside

    - they're tied together

        - if internal project value is high, share price is high

- public companies

    - relates to the way shares are traded
    - traded on a public forum, e.g. stock exchange
    - pool of potential investors is enormous

- private company

    - not listed on stock exchange
    - have to find a potential buyer myself to sell shares of a private company
    - shares are much lower value b/c less potential investors

- **primary (share) transaction**, when shares are initially sold, sold from corporation to individual/investor

    - you don't sell shares back to company

- **secondary (share) transaction**, shares sold from one investor to another investor

- sole proprietorship

    - cheap to run 
    - taxed as an individual
    - directly involved in the control of that business (authority)
    - unlimited liability
    - difficult to raise money
    - disolved when the sole proprietor dies

- partnership

    - disolved when one of the partners dies
    - could have unlimited liability without a provision for responsibility (?)
    - very similiar to sole proprietorship
    - shared control with other partners

- corporation

    - is its own legal entity
    - limited liability (if invest in company)
        
        - liability limited to size of investment

    - company is taxed
    - individuals pay taxes on dividends payed to them by company
    - shared control with other shareholders, proportional to the proportion of shares you own
    - board of directors act on shareholders interest
    - shareholders generally don't have visibility on what's going on within the company
    
        - cost associated with giving shareholders visibility of whats going on in the company
