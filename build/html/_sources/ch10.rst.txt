Ch 10: Company Performance Evaluation
=====================================

- typical business investments do not grow

    - a particular Tim Hortons location cannot indefinitely increase the number of donuts and cups of coffee it sells
    - it has constraints preventing this (e.g. space)
    - Tim Hortons grows by adding locations, which requires expenditures like trade capital (TC) and depreciable assets (CAPX)

- this chapter applies techniques of Chapter 9 to entire companies instead (that grow) instead of individual business investments (that do not grow)

Applications of the WACC
------------------------

- **the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)**, a methodology for using financial market information to *indirectly* determine an opportunity cost rate of return for a firm's assets as the weighted average of the cost of the opportunity cost rates of returns for financial assets

Expansion Projects
``````````````````

- WACC can be used for analysis of *expansion type projects*
- WACC is an opportunity cost rate for *existing assets*
- We can use the WACC in NPV analysis to value a firm's existing assets
- We can use the WACC to value new ventures **if** these ventures have the same risk as existing operations

    - we can describe the new venture as an expansion

- Even if a new venture is known to have greater or lesser risk than a firm's existing business, the WACC is still a useful approximation

    - might calc WACC then add/subtract a project specific increment to reflect the difference in risk

Corporate Performance Evaluation
````````````````````````````````

- WACC can be used for corporate performance evaluation
- the rate of return on invested capital after tax and after depreciation is the rate of return that a firm earns for all of its financial asset holders
- one doesn't know if this ROIC is high/low unless we benchmark instead
    
    - WACC is the appropriate benchmark

- if expected ROIC for a firm > a firm's WACC, then the firm is able to generate returns for its financial asset-holders that exceed their composite opportunity cost -- the WACC

    - financial characteristics of such a firm

        - high price/earnings ratio
        - high market-to-book ratio
        - high share price (or high shareholders' wealth for a private coproration)


.. math::

    \text{let D = debt} \\
    \text{let E = equity} \\
    \text{let V = investment?} \\
    \\
    D + E = V


.. math::

    WACC = \frac {E_1} V * r_{e1} + \frac {E_2} V * r_{e2} + \frac {D_1} V * (1 - \tau) + \frac {D_2} V * (1 - \tau)


.. math::

    E_1 + E_2 + D_1 + D_2 = V
