Equity Securities and Equity Markets
====================================

- shares give you a say in the management of a company
- value of a share is the present value of the future cash flows

    - question: what are those cash flows going to look like?

- valuation is far less certain than bonds
- non-voting shares are so the share issuer can maintain control of a company
- dividends are discretionary, they may or may not be paid out
    
    - companies don't like sending negative signals to the market, and not paying dividends is a negative signal
    - paying a dividend despite a bad year signals that the company is assured in that the bad performance is temporary
    - being conservative about paying dividends allows companys to pay dividends despite bad years

Preference Share
----------------

- also called a preferred share
- has a fixed dividend
- preferred shareholders are paid out dividends before common share holder
- preferred shareholders get paid off first if the company folds and the assets are liquidated
    
    - order of pay

        - liquidators, lawyers
        - gov't
        - employees
        - debt holders
        - preferred shareholders
        - common shareholders

- often do not have voting power

.. math::

    PV  &= P \\
        &= \frac {Div} r

Market Capitalization Rate
--------------------------

Cash Cow
````````

.. image:: straight_line

.. math::

    Pr = \frac {Div} r

Constant Growth
```````````````

.. image:: constant_growth

.. math::

    Pr = \frac {Div} {r - g}


Example
'''''''

:: 

    Div = 2
    r = 0.1
    g = 0.05

.. math::

    Pr_{t=0}    &= \frac {2} {0.1 - 0.05} \\
                &= 40

.. math::

    Pr_{t=1.00001}  &= \frac {2 * 1.05} {0.1 - 0.05} \\
                    &= 42

.. math:: 

    Pr_{t=0.99999}  &= \frac {2} {0.1 - 0.05} * (1 + 0.1) \\
                    &= 44


Example
-------

b = retention ratio

    This number means that
    for every dollar of earnings available for distribution to shareholders, the firm distributes 100*(1-b) cents
    as a dividend to shareholders and retains 100*b cents for business reinvestment and growth.

E = earnings

.. image:: earnings

- ROE here is different than the historic ROE we looked at before
- this ROE is on new money invested

.. math::

    \text{% growth in earnings} &= \frac {b*E*ROE} {E} \\
                                &= b*ROE \\
                                &= g

.. math::

    Pr  &= \frac {Div} {r - g} \\ 
        &= \frac {(1 - b)*E} {r - b*ROE}

- as b increases, the numerator decreases
- as b increases, the denominator decreases
- which effect dominates? it depends

====    =====   =====   =====

- is the company doing well with the money it's retaining?
    
    - base standard investment rate is 0.1
    - case 1, ROE = 0.2 > 0.1 = r -> company is doing well with my money its retaining
    - case 2, ROE > 0.5 < 0.1 = r -> company is not doing well with the money its retaining


(N)PVGO = (net) present value of growth opportunities

    - what happens when b is 0?

Efficient Market Hypothesises
-----------------------------

- if you have a free operating market with low transaction costs and information is freely available then prices are correct

- **Weak Market Efficiency**, prices encorporate all past prices

    - inefficient in this way if people can look at historical prices to make an abnormal return

- **Semi-strong Market Efficiency**, all public information is incorporated in share prices
    
    - e.g. finding gold -> price change immediately before buyers can act, since sellers know the information too
    - inefficient in this way if people can use public knowledge to make an abnormal return
    - most people think that the market is efficient in at least the semi-strong form

- **Strong Market Efficiency**, all public and private information is incorporated in share prices

    - inefficient in this way if people can use insider knowledge to make an abnormal return

- if market is inefficient, then there are incorrect prices, and people can make an abnormal return

    - can people identify stocks for which the price is over/undervalued? if so, market is inefficient in some way
